Hello! I'm your go-to assistant for exploring the data on this dashboard. I can help you filter, sort, and analyze information to gain insights.

Here are some things you can ask me:

*   **Filtering and Sorting:**
    * <span class="suggestion">"Show me all projects in the 'Construction' phase."</span>
    * <span class="suggestion">"List the projects with a budget over $500,000, ordered by their planned end date."</span>
    * <span class="suggestion">"Filter projects to only include those in District 5."</span>

*   **Data Analysis and Questions:**
    * <span class="suggestion">"What is the total budget for all projects?"</span>
    * <span class="suggestion">"What is the average budget amount for each project type?"</span>
    * <span class="suggestion">"Which project has the highest budget?"</span>
    * <span class="suggestion">"What is the median Final Estimate of Actual Costs?"</span>
